> A SOAP client and server for node.js with added support for ntlm requiests.

Inspired by https://github.com/vpulim/node-soap ( latest version 0.10.3 ) and https://github.com/piotr-gawlowski/node-soap
A pull requiest was started in original node-soap, if merged with master this package will be taken down.

Usage:
``` javascript
  var url = "http://server/instance/ReportService2010.asmx";
var options = {
    wsdl_options: {
        ntlm: true,
        username: "RSUser",
        password: "Reporting2012",
        workstation: "",
        domain: ""
    }
};

soap.createClient(url, options, function (err, client, body) {
    if (err) {
        console.log(err);
    }
    // normal use
    //client.setSecurity(new soap.NtlmSecurity(options.wsdl_options.userName, options.wsdl_options.password, options.wsdl_options.domain, options.wsdl_options.workstation));
    // or object can be passed
    client.setSecurity(new soap.NtlmSecurity(options.wsdl_options));

    console.log(client.describe());
    report = client.ReportingService2010.ReportingService2010Soap;
});
```
